# NGS

The Nexus Gaming Series, the amateur Heroes of the Storm league, as a data source:
teams, logos, rosters, the schedule, results and standings. Read from the league's
source, [nexusgamingseries/ngs-mean-core] on `development` at `5ef0ef6`
(2026-10-26), then checked against the live API on 2026-10-29, during season 22's
playoffs. Responses are kept out of the repository; every shape below was measured,
and where the source and the live answer disagree, the live answer is what is written.

## It is open, and a studio may read it directly

Every read a broadcast wants needs no key and no login; the routes behind a login are
writes (reporting, scheduling, casters signing up) and bulk queries a show does not
need.

**A studio reads it from the worker, with no relay.** `server.js` sets
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on every request. Measured from a page served as
`https://studio.example` in Chromium: a `GET`, and a JSON `POST` with its preflight,
both returned data. The preflight answers `200` with the CORS headers and
`Allow: POST`. The check can fail: the same page's `fetch()` of an S3 logo, which
carries no CORS header, threw `Failed to fetch`.

The host is Heroku. Measured against `https://nexusgamingseries.org`; the site's own
client uses `https://www.nexusgamingseries.org`, which this container's network
policy did not allow, so whether one redirects to the other is unchecked.

## The envelope

GET routes read parameters from the query string, POST routes from a JSON body. Every
answer is

```json
{ "message": "…", "route": "/api/…", "returnObject": … }
```

and the payload is `returnObject`. A missing required parameter is a `400` or `500`
whose `message` lists what was wanted; an unknown `matchId` is a `400`.

`division` is the `divisionConcat` — `heroic`, `nexus`, `a`, `b-east`, `b-west`,
`c-east`, `c-west` in season 22 — not the display name.

**The season's matches come from `schedule/fetch/matches`**, with only `season`:
`division` and `round` are optional, and one division alone is 69KB. The route named
for scheduled matches looks like the one to use and is not: it keeps only matches
with a start time, 278 of 321, and reads the current season whatever it is asked.
Neither match route carries the division's display name — `divisionDisplayName` is on
0 of 321 from `fetch/matches` and absent from `fetch/match` — so names come from
`division/get/all`.

## Where the league's API is wrong, measured

- **`team/get` takes `teamId`, not `id`.** The league's docs say `id`; it answers
  `500` with a message listing `teamId`.
- **`team/fetch/teams` by `teamIds` never finds anything.** The route builds
  `{ _ids: { $in: … } }` — a typo for `_id` — and lowercases the ids besides. Two ids
  from a live match returned `[]`; the same two teams by name returned both. Use
  names, tickers, or `team/get?teamId=` one at a time.
- **`casted/playing` is probably always empty.** It asks Mongo for
  `scheduledTime.startTime < Date.now()`, a number, and every one of season 22's 278
  matches stores its times as strings (`"1793236500000"`). Mongo does not compare a
  string with a number, so nothing matches. It returned `[]` here, but at an hour
  with no match in its window either, so that is not proof; one call during a
  scheduled cast settles it. Built on, it would fail silently, so the plugin does not
  depend on it.

All three are worth reporting upstream, along with the scheduled-matches route
ignoring its `season`.

## The shapes

**A match** carries most of what a scoreboard draws, so one request is enough for it:

```json
{
  "matchId": "9j1jaymvek8jy8",
  "season": 22,
  "divisionConcat": "heroic",
  "divisionDisplayName": "Heroic",
  "round": 2,
  "type": "tournament",
  "boX": 5,
  "home": { "id": "695d…", "teamName": "Pending", "ticker": "PENDING", "logo": null, "score": 2 },
  "away": { "id": "6867…", "teamName": "Hat saika and r", "ticker": "hsr", "logo": null, "score": 3 },
  "scheduledTime": { "startTime": "1793236500000", "endTime": "1793241900000" },
  "casterName": "Rakugan The Gorgon",
  "casterUrl": "https://www.twitch.tv/rakuganvt/",
  "mapBans": { "homeOne": "Braxis Holdout", "homeTwo": "Volskaya Foundry", "awayOne": "…", "awayTwo": "…" },
  "other": { "1": { "winner": "away" }, "2": { "winner": "home" } },
  "reported": true
}
```

Counted over all 321 matches of season 22:

- `type` is `seasonal` (282) or `tournament` (39, the playoffs). `boX` is present on
  only 26: 22 tournament matches say 5, 4 seasonal ones say 3, and 17 tournament
  matches have none. Absent means the model's default of 3, which for a playoff
  match is probably wrong, so the plugin leaves it null rather than guess.
- Times are **epoch milliseconds as strings**. 43 matches have none: nobody
  scheduled them. 25 of those are reported anyway, 24 of them as forfeits.
- **A side can be missing.** Playoff brackets are made ahead of time, and 16 slots
  were waiting on one team or both, with no `home` or `away` key at all.
- `casterName` is on 122 of 321.
- `other` holds the winner of each game, once reported.
- Some ids are tournament bracket links: `parentId`, `idChildren`, and the
  Challonge references.

**The score is only there once a captain reports the match.** None of the 31
unreported matches had a `score` on either side, three of them already past their
start. So the plugin is not a live scoreboard: during a series the operator keeps the
score, and the league's result arrives after it. The plugin must not overwrite a score
the operator is keeping with a missing one.

**A team** (`team/get`): `_id`, `teamName`, `ticker`, `logo`, `divisionConcat`,
`captain`, `assistantCaptain`, `teamMembers` as `{ displayName, id }` (BattleTags,
`WHRoger#2994`), plus `twitch`, `twitter`, `youtube` and MMR averages. In season 22,
tickers and ids are unique across all 52 teams, and 3 have no logo.

**A standing** is an array, already sorted:

```json
{
  "standing": 1,
  "teamName": "Stormblessed",
  "id": "6a36…",
  "logo": "Stormblessed_3562.png",
  "points": 30,
  "wins": 16,
  "losses": 2,
  "dominations": 6,
  "matchesPlayed": 8,
  "tiebreakMethod": "points",
  "change": "none"
}
```

`wins` and `losses` are **maps**, not matches. The order is the league's own tiebreak —
points, then head to head, then map differential — so the plugin keeps it rather than
re-sorting. A withdrawn team stays in, renamed: `Heretics and Heathens (Withdrawn
S22)`. Cup divisions use a different, smaller shape, `{ teamName, id, points }`, from
tournament placings; none existed in season 22.

**A team really is called `Pending`.** Ticker `PENDING`, second in Heroic. Nothing may
treat the name as a placeholder.

**A logo is a filename**, `Stormblessed_3562.png`. The site's client turns it into
`https://s3.amazonaws.com/ngs-image-storage/` plus the name, URI-encoded; a past
season's logo lives in `ngs-archive-image` instead. S3 serves them as
`application/octet-stream` and without CORS headers, which does not matter for an
`<img>`: measured in Chromium, it loads at 500×350, and a missing name fires `error`.
So a logo goes into the show as that URL, and core's `<Image>` draws it as is. For
the three teams without one the value is empty, and an `<Image>` with an empty value
draws nothing; how a team with no logo looks is the studio's design. It cannot be fetched into the asset
library's IndexedDB, which would need CORS.

## What was built

`packages/plugin-ngs`, to move to a repository of its own with its own versions; it
does not ship with Single Studio.

Not a poller, and it never asks for a score. The owner's call, on 2026-10-29: team
names do not change during a show and the score is the operator's, kept on the
board. What the plugin brings changes between shows, so it fetches when told, on the
machine where it was told; a press is one request, so there is nothing for an owner
to dedupe.

It is a waterfall, and each step is a filter the league applies, not one applied
after a download:

| Step                      | Requests                                                   | Event     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Fetch season (panel)      | `getSeasonInfo`, `division/get/all`, `team/get/registered` | `season`  |
| Choose a division (board) | `schedule/fetch/matches` with `season` and `division`      | `matches` |
| Load a match (board)      | `schedule/fetch/match`, `standings/fetch/division`         | `match`   |

A division is 43 matches, 69KB, 0.6s, where the whole season was 321, 514KB, 1.6s.
The first version fetched the whole season and filtered on the board; asked whether
the steps were filters, it was rebuilt so they are.

- **Choosing and loading are the board's.** A plugin's panel holds buttons, not
  choices, so they are mutations (`ngsMutations`) that ask the plugin.
- **No score anywhere.** A match side is `{ id, name, ticker, logo, record }`; the
  bans and per-game winners, which exist only once a match is reported, are not
  carried either. `reported` stays, so a picker can leave played matches out.
- **Logos go into the image library as URL entries**, `ngs/<team name>`, through
  `urlAssets` in the studio's handler; the plugin still writes nothing. That needed a
  fix in core: a URL entry only in the room's index was offered by every picker and
  drew nothing on a graphic, because `resolveAsset` read only this machine's
  IndexedDB, and a plugin handler writes from the worker, so its entries are only in
  the index. Now `useAssetUrl` falls back to the index for a URL entry; an e2e check
  deletes a URL entry's local row and still sees the graphic draw it, and fails
  without the fix. A team with no logo gets no entry and an empty logo, and
  draws nothing, which is unchanged.
- **The map pool is a copy.** The API does not serve it; the league's
  match-reporting page has it as a list in the code. Twelve maps.
- **A table that will not come does not lose the match.** Cup divisions answer in a
  different shape, and none existed to measure.

Still open: whether "this week's match" wants a queue rather than one selection;
what a cup division's table looks like; and `casted/playing` during a live cast.
